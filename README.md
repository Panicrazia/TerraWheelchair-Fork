This is a fork of the original TerraWheelchair mod, I wanted to change it to what I thought was a better mod in terms of balance, useablility, and masochistic fun, because I wasnt able to play a merfolk in my most recent terraria multiplayer experience

Soon I realized that I would have to essentially rebuild the mod from the ground up, to fundamentally change the wheelchair from a projectile into a mount

This is mainly just a place to have the code of the original if for whatever reason it gets lost/hidden/banished/whatever, the actual real wheelchair mod that im making is [in a different repository](https://github.com/Panicrazia/MackWheelers)
