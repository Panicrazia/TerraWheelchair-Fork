This is a fork of the original TerraWheelchair mod, I wanted to change it to what I thought was a better mod in terms of balance, useablility, and masochistic fun, because I wasnt able to play a merfolk in my most recent terraria multiplayer experience



# TerraWheelchair
泰拉瑞亚轮椅Mod

v0.9.5 更新：重写网络部分，现在多人的稳定性得到了极大提升，轮椅不会再在手上抽搐了


加入了一个支持载人和推动、投掷的轮椅实体！

- 为联机整活而生！让你的小伙伴们坐上你的轮椅被你带飞（或者让他们来载你）
- 双人轮椅开荒挑战？试试禁止移动然后让你的朋友用轮椅载着你开荒（你可以在轮椅上输出）

轮椅冒险愉快！

合成表:
在工作台空手合成
（1.4tml版本中不需要工作台）

机制:
* 轮椅物品
- 使用时召唤你的轮椅实体
- 当手持这个物品时，如果你在轮椅旁边，你会自动握住轮椅，你可以推着它一起移动、跳跃、飞行（甚至骑坐骑）
- 当握住轮椅时，再次点击鼠标左键，就会把轮椅向鼠标方向投掷（轮椅上的玩家也会一起被投掷）
- 如果轮椅在远处，再次点击鼠标左键，轮椅会从远处被收回到玩家身边

* 轮椅证书
- 把轮椅证书标记为喜爱（Alt+单击）时才可以坐上轮椅（如果你想当推轮椅的人，就不要标记为喜爱）
- 标记为喜爱时，会自动坐上附近的空轮椅
- 坐在轮椅上时，推轮椅的人搬运、投掷、传送轮椅时，你会被一起带动

* 备注
- 只有轮椅的召唤者可以推动这个轮椅实体。如果你想推轮椅，你需要召唤一个自己的轮椅（不能推别人召唤的）
- 标记轮椅证书时你甚至可以坐在自己召唤的轮椅上（单人游戏中这是唯一的坐轮椅方式） 在这种情况下，轮椅会进入电动模式，自动慢慢往前运行

几天前刚开始学做MOD，实现比较乱，请见谅


This above chinese text was the original readme from the original mod and has been autotranslated into this, it is not an accurate description of what the mod does in my version:

  Terraria Wheelchair Mod
  
  v0.9.5 Update: Rewrote the networking section, multiplayer stability is now greatly improved and the wheelchair doesn't twitch in your hand anymore!
  
  
  Added a wheelchair entity that supports carrying and pushing and throwing!
  
  - Made for online whole living! Get your buddies in your wheelchair to be carried by you (or let them carry you)
  - Double wheelchair opening challenge? Try disabling mobility and then letting your friend drive you in your wheelchair (you can output from your wheelchair)!
  
  Happy wheelchair adventures!
  
  Synthesis Table.
  Synthesize empty-handed at the workbench
  (Workbench is not needed in 1.4tml version)
  
  Mechanisms.
  * Wheelchair Item
  - Summons your wheelchair entity when used
  - When holding this item, if you are next to a wheelchair, you will automatically hold the wheelchair and you can push it along to move, jump, fly (even ride a mount)
  - While holding the wheelchair, clicking the left mouse button again will throw the wheelchair in the direction of the mouse (the player in the wheelchair will be thrown along with it)
  - If the wheelchair is at a distance, clicking the left mouse button again will retrieve the wheelchair to the player from the distance
  
  * :: Wheelchair certificates
  - You can only sit in the wheelchair when you mark the wheelchair certificate as favorite (Alt+click) (don't mark it as favorite if you want to be the wheelchair pusher)
  - When marked as favorite, you will automatically sit in an empty wheelchair nearby
  - When you are in a wheelchair, you will be driven along with the wheelchair pusher when he/she carries, throws, or transfers the wheelchair.
  
  * Remarks
  - Only the summoner of the wheelchair can push this wheelchair entity. If you want to push a wheelchair, you need to summon a wheelchair of your own (you can't push one summoned by someone else)
  - You can even sit in your own summoned wheelchair when marking the wheelchair certificate (in single player this is the only way to sit in a wheelchair) In this case, the wheelchair will go into motorized mode and automatically run forward slowly
  
  I just started learning how to make mods a few days ago, the implementation is quite messy, please forgive me!
